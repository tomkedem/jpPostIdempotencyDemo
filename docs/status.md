# Project Status

## Current Phase
Planning and Documentation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Documentation structure setup
- [x] Basic README created

## In Progress
- [ ] Core idempotency implementation
- [ ] API endpoint development
- [ ] Storage layer implementation

## Blocked
- None currently

## Next Steps
1. Choose technology stack
2. Implement basic idempotency key handling
3. Create storage abstraction
4. Develop API endpoints
5. Add comprehensive tests

## Notes
- Project focuses on demonstrating POST request idempotency patterns
- Need to decide on storage backend (Redis, in-memory, database)
- Consider different idempotency strategies (key-based, hash-based)
